            <span class="entry-description">I have keyboards powered by the QMK firmware. I develop keyboard layouts in C, which are flashed to the keyboards to allow for macros, custom layers, layout switching, mouse control and ergonomic keybinds. My layouts are made for the OLKB Planck and DM9Records Plaid, and are adaptable to any 4x12 ortholinear keyboard.</span></div>

            <span class="entry-description">A program used to get Islamic prayer time data using the al-adhan API. Written in Racket (part of the Lisp family) and targeting Termux, an Android terminal. Designed as a proof of concept to develop phone applications using Termux to run them on the same Android phone, without having to worry about Android specifics</div>

            <span class="entry-description">A tool made to parametrically design my wallpaper. Sometimes I like to change colour schemes, or adjust bits of the wallpaper, and I don't like opening Inkscape every time just to do that. With the Wallpaper Generator I just adjust a single setting and suddently everything is exactly how I want it. The Wallpaper Generator can output to any resolution, making it easy to use the same wallpaper on multiple devices without any hassle.</div>
