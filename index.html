          <h3>Web Development</h3>
        </a>
        <p>
        I write HTML, CSS and JavaScript daily as part of my entrepreneur work. I also manage these technologies on web server backends. My current job involves heavy use of node.js, ExpressJS and Pug. I am also familiar with the following:</p>
        <ul>
         <li>WebSockets</li>
         <li>Web Workers</li>
         <li>JavaScript Promises</li>
         <li>Querying databases</li>
         <li>Querying REST APIs</li>
         <li>Scraping websites for data </li>
        </ul>

          <h3>General Purpose Programming Languages</h3>
        </a>
        <p>I can code in Python, Perl, Scheme and other general purpose programming languages. My projects involving these languages include a parser for a hardware keyboard emulator (Perl), a prototype for MatchGorithm's Matcher (Racket) and a library for drawing colour graphics on a terminal (Perl). </p>

          <h3>Object-Oriented Programming</h3>
        </a>
        <p>I learned how to use Java and C# at university. I know how to use object oriented techniques to structure programs, and how best to reuse code by wrapping it in objects. I am also familiar with more complex patterns, such as the Abstract Factory or the Singleton. Most of my projects with these languages are small C# scripts made to extend the video game Space Engineers, which allows for spaceship automation with the language.</p>

          <h3>Databases</h3>
        </a>
        <p>I have experience working with SQL. I can create tables, create relations between tables, and insert/remove data from them. I know how to select for specific datasets, and how to join tables to get information scattered between them. I know how to query databases using external libraries, to allow them to be used in larger programming projects.</p>
        <p>I tend to use SQLite when starting a project, for it's simplicity. Over the course of a project's development I usually switch to PostgreSQL once I'm sure everything works as intended.</p>

          <h3>Embedded Development</h3>
        </a>
        <p>I like playing with microcontrollers. I have experience using Arduino boards with their IDEs to make tiny machines do interesting things.
    My largest project created completely by myself was a TAS tool designed for my university final year project. I used a Beaglebone Black and a Teensy 2.0 to create a device which could pretend to be a keyboard and play back prerecorded inputs, similar to a Pianola.</p><p>My second large project is a programmable mechanical keyboard keymap. I write code in C containing information on what I want each key to do, and any other code I want the keyboard to execute, and then flash it directly to the microcontrollers powering the keyboard. This allows me to adjust everything about my keyboard to suit my needs, to improve ergonomics and add more functionality</p>

          <h3>Linux</h3>
        </a>
        <p>I have 10 years of experience with using Linux as a standard desktop operating system. I have 5 years of experience with running Linux servers, with my server being an ARM-based single board computer. I know how to troubleshoot issues as and when they arrive, and am familiar enough with terminology to know how to search for effective solutions to more complex problems.</p>

          <h3>MatchGorithm</h3>
        </a>
        <p>I work with a fellow university graduate to solve problems related to resource allocation. We have a mutually designed algorithm which efficiently solves various industry problems, and are trying to turn it into a practical application.</p>
        <p>More specifically, the Matcher uses AI-adjacent concepts to process datasets until we get useful answers. It has configuration options to allow us to interact with every tiny aspect of it's inner workings, and can even do things such as stop early if it finds satisfactory answers. It includes a testing suite, various GUIs and an entire website to control access to the service.</p>
        <p>Prototypes of our software were originally designed in Racket (a member of the Lisp family) to allow for more convenient data structure manipulation and automation. The current version uses JavaScript with a few Lisp-inspired coding concepts, and runs on node.js serverside.</p>

          <h3>Turtle</h3>
        </a>
        <p>I created this simplified version of the old LOGO teaching tool as a way to play around with clientside JavaScript and HTML's Canvas. Turtle allows users to draw pictures by describing how the turtle should move, and if it should draw as it moves. Turtle uses many interesting programming tricks to make the code more capable, including a jump list to parse input and clever use of the modulo function to adjust the turtle's direction</p>

          <h3>Crypto Price Checker</h3>
        </a>
        <p>
        A small application made to display the value of various amounts of Bitcoin. A user can input the amount they have in various wallets, and the application will keep track of how much those wallets are worth in Â£.
        </p>
        <p>
        This application was made to experiment with Electron, a framework for turning web server applications into desktop ones. It uses a REST API to obtain the current price of Bitcoin, and performs the rest of the calculations on the client's computer.

          <h3>Prayer Times Finder</h3>
        </a>
        <p>
        A small application made to display the day's Islamic prayer times. Outputs directly to a terminal.
        </p>
        <p>
        This application was made both as a way to test the usage of REST APIs, and the effectiveness of developing software on a phone. The vast majority of the code was written in Android's Termux terminal emulator, and was then neatened up on a computer after the fact. The application is it's own configuration file, with it's configuration struct appearing at the top of the file. This is to make it easier to work with on a tiny screen, so anyone making edits does not have to juggle multiple files.

          <h3>Wallpaper Generator</h3>
        </a>
        <p>
        A small application made to parametrically generate wallpapers using a fixed design. It can generate wallpapers for any resolution, and comes with a builtin set of palettes.
        </p>
        <p>
        This application was made as a test of Racket's pict library, and as a way of experimenting with working with s-expressions. I made it because I wasn't too impressed with the minimalistic wallpapers I found on the Internet, and wanted something more interesting. The palettes are taken from various places, including branding documents for Ubuntu and OpenSUSE.

          <h3>QMK keyboard config</h3>
        </a>
        <p>
        Various scripts made to define the functionality of various reprogrammable keyboards. Made to take advantage of features such as layers, multi-function keys and macros.
        </p>
        <p>
        These layouts are written in C, and are to be used with QMK. They're made to target 4x12 ortholinear keyboards, such as the OLKB Planck.
