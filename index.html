          <h3>Web Development and JavaScript</h3>
        </a>
        <p>
        I use HTML, CSS and JavaScript daily as part of my entrepreneur work. I am familiar with using clientside JS to adjust website functionality, using websockets for quick communication between clients and using webworkers for multithreading. I've also used various templating engines in the past, with my most familiar one being Pug/Jade.
        </p>
        <p>
    The current version of MatchGorithm's software uses these technologies along with Electron to provide a practical product. It uses our internally developed library to implement the algorithm, Bytenode to obfuscate and preprocess the code and HTML and CSS to provide a graphical user interface, with a minimal amount of JS for functionality.</p>

          <h3>Python and similar languages</h3>
        </a>
        <p>
        I use a variant of Python called MicroPython to work with microcontrollers. I have also taught people how to code using Python in the past.
        </p>
        <p>
        I started programming with perl, a very popular language from the '90s. Unfortunately most of my perl projects are lost to time. They included various websites made using CGI.pm, a primitive equivalent to SVG made to display graphics in terminals, and an application to generate .png files from a given configuration.

          <h3>Scheme and Functional Programming</h3>
        </a>
        <p>
        Scheme is a minimalist functional programming language from the Lisp family, and one of my most used languages. I generally use it to build prototypes to later port to other languages if required. The original prototype for my work at MatchGorithm was done using it, and included a web server and test suite.

          <h3>Databases</h3>
        </a>
        <p>
        I have used PostgreSQL and SQLite in the past, and understand the basics behind using SQL to manipulate data. I know how to apply relational database concepts to create logically sensible tables, and how to use primary and foreign keys and joins to get relevant data from databases.

          <h3>Embedded Development</h3>
        </a>
        <p>I like playing with microcontrollers. I have experience using Arduino boards with their IDEs to make tiny machines do interesting things.
    My largest project created completely by myself was a TAS tool designed for my university final year project. I used a Beaglebone Black and a Teensy 2.0 to create a device which could pretend to be a keyboard and play back prerecorded inputs, similar to a Pianola.</p><p>My second large project is a programmable mechanical keyboard keymap. I write code in C containing information on what I want each key to do, and any other code I want the keyboard to execute, and then flash it directly to the microcontrollers powering the keyboard. This allows me to adjust everything about my keyboard to suit my needs, to improve ergonomics and add more functionality</p>

          <h3>Linux</h3>
        </a>
        <p>I have 10 years of experience with using Linux as a standard desktop operating system. I have 5 years of experience with running Linux servers, with my server being an ARM-based single board computer. I know how to troubleshoot issues as and when they arrive, and am familiar enough with terminology to know how to search for effective solutions to more complex problems.</p>

          <h3>MatchGorithm</h3>
        </a>
        <p>I work with a fellow university graduate to solve problems related to resource allocation. We have a mutually designed algorithm which efficiently solves various industry problems, and are trying to turn it into a practical application.</p><p>
    I am the lead (and only) programmer. My job involves taking our mutually designed algorithm, adapting it to code, creating a frontend to allow for easy data input and output, and packaging all of that into an easily usable system. I write code, design frontends and fix bugs.</p>

          <h3>Crypto Price Checker</h3>
        </a>
        <p>
        A small application made to display the value of various amounts of Bitcoin. A user can input the amount they have in various wallets, and the application will keep track of how much those wallets are worth in Â£.
        </p>
        <p>
        This application was made to experiment with Electron, a framework for turning web server applications into desktop ones. It uses a REST API to obtain the current price of Bitcoin, and performs the rest of the calculations on the client's computer.

          <h3>Prayer Times Finder</h3>
        </a>
        <p>
        A small application made to display the day's Islamic prayer times. Outputs directly to a terminal.
        </p>
        <p>
        This application was made both as a way to test the usage of REST APIs, and the effectiveness of developing software on a phone. The vast majority of the code was written in Android's Termux terminal emulator, and was then neatened up on a computer after the fact. The application is it's own configuration file, with it's configuration struct appearing at the top of the file. This is to make it easier to work with on a tiny screen, so anyone making edits does not have to juggle multiple files.

          <h3>Wallpaper Generator</h3>
        </a>
        <p>
        A small application made to parametrically generate wallpapers using a fixed design. It can generate wallpapers for any resolution, and comes with a builtin set of palettes.
        </p>
        <p>
        This application was made as a test of Racket's pict library, and as a way of experimenting with working with s-expressions. I made it because I wasn't too impressed with the minimalistic wallpapers I found on the Internet, and wanted something more interesting. The palettes are taken from various places, including branding documents for Ubuntu and OpenSUSE.

          <h3>QMK keyboard config</h3>
        </a>
        <p>
        Various scripts made to define the functionality of various reprogrammable keyboards. Made to take advantage of features such as layers, multi-function keys and macros.
        </p>
        <p>
        These layouts are written in C, and are to be used with QMK. They're made to target 4x12 ortholinear keyboards, such as the OLKB Planck.
